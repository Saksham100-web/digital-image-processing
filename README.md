Experiments on Digital Image Processing
To perform the experiments, please download the MatLab or use the online MatLab (https://matlab.mathworks.com/)
List of Experiments:
1. To study fundamentals of image processing and write program to read and display different types of digital images.
2. To Perform enhancement in spatial domain on digital images and write programs for gray-level transformations.
3. To Perform the histogram processing and histogram equalization.
4. To perform the thresholding operation
5. To perform detection of discontinuities: point, line and edges in a given image
6. To perform different arithmetic operations or logical operations such as addition etc.
7. To perform basic geometric transformations (2-D DFT, FFT etc.) on Digital Images
8. To write program for zooming and shrinking of digital images and compare Nearest Neighbor interpolation, Bilinear interpolation and Bicubic interpolation methods of zooming.
9. To Perform Spatial domain Enhancement using Filtration of digital images
10. To study and perform Image Restoration using Wiener Filters.
